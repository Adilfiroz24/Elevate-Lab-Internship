# Cybersecurity Internship – Task 1: Foundations & Threat Modeling

This repository documents my work for **Task 1** of the Cybersecurity Internship program, focusing on core security principles and attack surface analysis.

## 📖 Overview

The goal of this task was to build a foundational understanding of cybersecurity concepts, threat actors, and how to visualize system vulnerabilities.

## 📚 Topics Covered & Key Learnings

- **CIA Triad:** Explained the principles of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability with real-world case studies (e.g., data leaks, ransomware attacks).
- **Types of Cyber Attackers:** Categorized adversaries from Script Kiddies to Nation-State Actors based on skill, motive, and resources.
- **Attack Surface Analysis:** Identified and classified Digital, Physical, and Social entry points for potential attacks.
- **OWASP Top 10:** Reviewed the critical web application security risks, emphasizing Broken Access Control, Injection, and Cryptographic Failures.
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):** Learned to map data flow (User → Application → Server → Database) to identify potential security weak points.

## 🛠️ Practical Application

This task involved:
- Researching and summarizing core concepts.
- Applying theories to everyday applications (e.g., email, banking apps).
- Understanding how the OWASP Top 10 guides secure development.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `README.md` – This overview file.
- `Task1_Summary.pdf` – Detailed write-up of all concepts.
- `/docs` – (Optional) Any additional diagrams or notes.

## ✅ Outcome

A solid conceptual foundation in cybersecurity, threat awareness, and the initial skills for basic threat modeling and attack surface identification.
